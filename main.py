looking at the sky,
makes anyone cry.

in a realm we live,
one would never give
up their dream
but it seem
         
like some does
to avoid fuss
         
achievement is a gift,
that would one day drift.
         
to achieve our goal,
we must do with our soul.
         
face our problem brave,
with some rave.
         
life is short,
but we have time to sort
         
issues and fufillness,
to have some happiness
